    A CL description is a public record of **what** change is being made and **why**

    it was made. It will become a permanent part of our version control history, and

    will possibly be read by hundreds of people other than your reviewers over the

    years.

    Future developers will search for your CL based on its description. Someone in

    the future might be looking for your change because of a faint memory of its

    relevance but without the specifics handy. If all the important information is

    in the code and not the description, it's going to be a lot harder for them to

    locate your CL.

    The **first line** of a CL description should be a short summary of

    *specifically* **what** *is being done by the CL*, followed by a blank line.

    This is what most future code searchers will see when they are browsing the

    version control history of a piece of code, so this first line should be

    informative enough that they don't have to read your CL or its whole description

    just to get a general idea of what your CL actually *did*.

texts:

    By tradition, the first line of a CL description is a complete sentence, written

    as though it were an order (an imperative sentence). For example, say

    \"**Delete** the FizzBuzz RPC and **replace** it with the new system." instead

    of \"**Deleting** the FizzBuzz RPC and **replacing** it with the new system."

    You don't have to write the rest of the description as an imperative sentence,

    though.

    The rest of the description should be informative. It might include a brief

    description of the problem that's being solved, and why this is the best

    approach. If there are any shortcomings to the approach, they should be

    mentioned. If relevant, include background information such as bug numbers,

    benchmark results, and links to design documents.

    Servers like FizzBuzz have very large messages and would benefit from reuse.

      slowly over time, so that idle servers eventually release all freelist

    The first few words describe what the CL actually does. The rest of the

    description talks about the problem being solved, why this is a good solution,

    Add a Now method to Task, so the borglet() getter method can be removed (which
      was only used by OOMCandidate to call borglet's Now method). This replaces the
      methods on Borglet that delegate to a TimeKeeper.

texts:

    Allowing Tasks to supply Now is a step toward eliminating the dependency on
      Borglet. Eventually, collaborators that depend on getting Now from the Task
      should be changed to use a TimeKeeper directly, but this has been an
      accommodation to refactoring in small steps.

    The first line describes what the CL does and how this is a change from the

    past. The rest of the description talks about the specific implementation, the

    context of the CL, that the solution isn't ideal, and possible future direction.

    It also explains *why* this change is being made.

    This allows consumers who are already using this as in Python3 to depend on a
      rule that is next to the original status build rule instead of somewhere in
      their own tree. It encourages new consumers to use Python3 if they can,
      instead of Python2, and significantly simplifies some automated build file
      refactoring tools being worked on currently.
